Family plays a very important role in our lives.
  Without our family we will not have companions and who love and care for us.
  We need family members to share our feelings, moments of joy and sorrow in life. 
Having a healthy and prosperous family is a blessing. 
  Everyone loves their family and so do I. In my family we are six members; 
my mother, father, my grandfather and grandmother, my older sister and me. 
  My parents love and pampered me and my sister. 
  My grandparents also care for all of us a lot and are always by our side. 
  My sister always helps me with my homework and assignments and since 
I am very good at drawing and painting, I too help her with her art projects. As a family, 
we always enjoying spending time together. 
  My grandmother insists that we all must start the day by enjoying breakfast together. 
  My father always plans fun weekend activities for all of us to do together. 
  I love my family as they make me feel happy, safe and confident.
